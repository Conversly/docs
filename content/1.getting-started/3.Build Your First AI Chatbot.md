- Content to train your bot (Website URL, PDF, or text)

::steps
### Step 1: Create a New Agent

Navigate to the **Agent Builder** in your dashboard and click **Create New Agent**.

Give your agent a name (e.g., "Support Bot") and define its **Persona** and **System Prompt**.

#### Choose Agent Type

Click on the **Continue to Agent Builder** button. You can choose from four specialized agent types:

- **General AI Agent**: A versatile assistant for any task.
- **Customer Support**: Optimized for resolving queries and handling tickets.
- **Docs Assistant**: Best for searching through technical documentation.
- **Sales Agent**: Designed to qualify leads and drive conversions.

Once selected, you'll be taken to your new agent's dashboard where you can manage its settings, knowledge base, and deployment.

#### Agent Dashboard

Here is the final dashboard for a **General AI Agent**.

::prose-tip
**Example Prompt:**
"You are a helpful support assistant for [Your Company]. Your goal is to answer customer questions accurately using the provided knowledge base. Be polite, concise, and professional."
::

### Step 2: Add Knowledge Sources

Your agent needs specific knowledge about your business to answer questions accurately.

#### 1. Go to Data Sources

Navigate to the **Data Sources** tab in your agent's dashboard.

![Data Sources Tab](https://fpfwsswoz0yfjtoz.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/Screenshot%202026-02-19%20at%2010.05.56%E2%80%AFPM.png)

#### 2. Add Data Sources

Click on the **Add Data Sources** button. You can add knowledge sources using four different methods:

- **Websites**: Crawl your website to extract information.
- **Documents**: Upload files like PDFs, DOCX, or TXT.
- **Q&A**: Manually add Frequently Asked Questions.
- **Text**: Paste raw text content directly.

![Add Data Sources Options](https://fpfwsswoz0yfjtoz.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/Screenshot%202026-02-19%20at%2010.06.18%E2%80%AFPM.png)

#### 3. Upload Documents

Select the **Documents** option to upload your files. This is the most common way to train your agent on existing materials.

![Upload Documents](https://fpfwsswoz0yfjtoz.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/Screenshot%202026-02-19%20at%2010.07.07%E2%80%AFPM.png)

VerlyAI's engine will index your content, making it instantly searchable by the agent.

### Step 3: Test in Playground

Before going live, it's crucial to verify your agent's responses in the Playground.

#### 1. Chatbot Interface

You can interact with the chatbot directly in the dashboard to test how it responds to queries.

![Chatbot Playground](https://fpfwsswoz0yfjtoz.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/Screenshot%202026-02-19%20at%209.45.12%E2%80%AFPM-Sl10BEaRy9QjXgBpdp66Iuc4PVvM5I.png)

#### 2. Configure Agent Behavior

To fine-tune your agent, you have several settings available on the right-hand side:

1. **System Prompt**: Design your agent's persona and give it specific instructions on how to behave.
2. **Model Selection**: Choose the specific AI model that powers your agent.
3. **Temperature**: Adjust the creativity of the responses. Higher values make the agent more creative, while lower values make it more deterministic.

![Agent Configurations](https://fpfwsswoz0yfjtoz.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/Screenshot%202026-02-19%20at%209.59.06%E2%80%AFPM-jxDsTxSR4NSOSk9c6RFJYqCB67zQNZ.png)

1. Open the **Playground** tab.
2. Ask questions like "What are your pricing plans?" or "How do I reset my password?".
3. Refine your System Prompt or add more knowledge sources if the answers aren't accurate.

### Step 4: Deploy Your Agent

Once you're satisfied with your agent's behavior in the Playground, it's time to publish it.

![Deploy to Live](https://fpfwsswoz0yfjtoz.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/Screenshot%202026-02-20%20at%2012.40.33%E2%80%AFAM.png)

#### 1. Push to Live

In VerlyAI, you work in a **Draft (Dev)** environment. Changes made here (like updating the system prompt or adding knowledge) are safe and won't affect live users until you explicitly publish them.

1. Go to the **Deploy** tab.
2. Click **Publish to Production**.
3. Confirm the deployment.
