The difference between an "Account Owner" and an "Invited Owner" stems from who actually possesses the underlying account for billing purposes.

## The "Actual Creator" vs. "Invited Owner"

**Actual Creator (Account Owner):** When a user creates a new workspace, the system creates an underlying Account for billing purposes. The creator becomes the OWNER of that Account (`accountRole === 'OWNER'`) AND the OWNER of the Workspace (`workspaceRole === 'OWNER'`). Because they own the Account, they have exclusive access to manage all Billing capabilities and view billing data.

**Invited OWNER (Workspace Owner):** When you invite someone as an OWNER to a workspace, they are granted `workspaceRole === 'OWNER'`. However, they are not granted ownership of the underlying Account. Therefore, they have full control over the workspace (chatbots, members, settings) and they **can view** billing and billing analytics, but they **cannot manage** billing and subscriptions (e.g. they cannot change the credit card, upgrade/downgrade plans, etc.).
