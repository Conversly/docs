The difference between an "Account Owner" and an "Invited Owner" stems from who actually possesses the underlying account for billing purposes.

## 1. The Workspace Creator (OWNER)

**Workspace Creator (Account Owner):** When a user creates a new workspace, the system creates an underlying Account for billing purposes. The creator becomes the OWNER of that Account (`accountRole === 'OWNER'`) AND the OWNER of the Workspace (`workspaceRole === 'OWNER'`). Because they own the Account, they have exclusive access to manage all Billing capabilities and view billing data.

> [!NOTE]
> It is no longer possible to invite a user as an `OWNER`. The `OWNER` role is strictly reserved for the original creator of the workspace and account. To grant elevated permissions, users can be invited as an `ADMIN`.
