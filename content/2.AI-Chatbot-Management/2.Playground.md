The **Playground** is your sandbox for testing, debugging, and refining your AI agent before deploying it to customers. It allows you to simulate real conversations and fine-tune your agent's behavior in a safe environment.

## Interface Overview

The Playground consists of two main areas: the **Chat Interface** on the left and the **Configuration Panel** on the right.

### 1. Chat Interface
This is where you interact with your agent. You can type messages, ask questions, and see how the agent responds in real-time.

### 2. Configuration Panel
On the right side, you can adjust various settings to control how your agent behaves.

- **System Prompt**: This is the "brain" of your agent. You can modify the instructions to change its persona, tone, or rules.
- **Model Selection**: Choose which AI model powers your agent (e.g., GPT-4, Claude 3.5 Sonnet).
- **Temperature**: Controls the creativity of the responses.
  - **Low Temperature (0.0 - 0.3)**: More deterministic and focused. Good for support bots.
  - **High Temperature (0.7 - 1.0)**: More creative and varied. Good for brainstorming or casual chat.

## Features

### 🔍 Debug Mode
View the raw JSON inputs and outputs of the LLM. This helps you understand *why* the agent gave a specific response.

- **System Prompt**: See exactly what instructions the agent received.
- **Tool Calls**: Verify if the agent called the correct tool (e.g., `check_order_status`).
- **Context Window**: Check if previous messages are being correctly retained.

### 🧪 Scenario Testing
Test specific edge cases to ensure robustness:

- **Interruptions**: Try interrupting the agent (Voice mode) to test the *Turn-Taking Engine*.
- **Language Switching**: Switch languages mid-conversation to test multilingual capabilities.
- **Escalation**: Act frustrated or ask for a human to verify the *Smart Escalation* logic.

**Best Practice**: Always test your changes in the Playground after updating the System Prompt or Knowledge Base.
