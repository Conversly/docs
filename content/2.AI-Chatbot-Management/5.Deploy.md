Move your draft changes from the development environment to your public live chatbot.

## Deployment Workflow

VerlyAI uses a two-stage environment to ensure stability:

1.  **Draft (Dev)**: Your sandbox environment. All changes made in the dashboard (Instructions, Knowledge Base, Behavior) are saved here instantly but are **not** visible to end-users.
2.  **Production (Live)**: The version of your agent that your actual customers interact with.

## Current Status

The dashboard provides a clear view of your agent's version history:

- **Live Version**: The version currently serving customers (e.g., v9).
- **Draft Version**: The version you are currently working on (e.g., v10).
- **State**: Indicates if there are "Unpublished changes" waiting to be deployed.
- **Last Deployed**: The date of the last successful publish to production.

## Push to Live

When you are ready to release your changes:

1.  Click the **Publish to Production** button.
2.  **Review**: Confirm that you want to overwrite the Live version with your Draft.
3.  **Deploy**: The process takes 1-2 minutes.

**Downtime Alert**: Your chatbot will be inactive for a short duration (1-2 minutes) during deployment as the new model is provisioned.

## Rollback Changes

If you make a mistake or the new version behaves unexpectedly, you can revert to the previous meaningful state.

- **Discard Draft**: If you haven't published yet, you can discard your current draft changes and restore the layout from the Live version.
- **Restore Previous Version**: (Coming Soon) Rollback the Live agent to a specific historical version.
