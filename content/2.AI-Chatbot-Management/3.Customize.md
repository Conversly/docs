Make your AI agent an extension of your brand. VerlyAI offers deep customization options for identity, behavior, and visual appearance. The customization options are divided into four main tabs: **Add Content**, **Appearance**, **System Prompt**, and **Integration**.

## 1. Add Content

This tab allows you to configure how your chatbot engages with users initially.

### Initial Message
Set the first message your chatbot sends to greet users. You can customize this to be friendly, professional, or brand-specific.

### Starter Questions
Add default questions that appear as clickable chips to help users get started.
- "What are your pricing plans?"
- "How do I contact support?"

### Message Settings
Customize the message input area and display options to match your user interface preferences.

### Calls & Attention
Configure voice entry points and optional popup or sound nudges to grab user attention when they visit your site.

## 2. Appearance

Make the chatbot look like a native part of your website.

### Icon Settings
Choose or upload a custom icon for your chat widget.
- **Preset Icons**: Select from a library of ready-to-use icons.
- **Custom Upload**: Upload your own brand logo. Custom icons will override presets.

### Size & Position
Configure the dimensions and placement of your widget on the screen (e.g., bottom-right vs. bottom-left).

### Button Settings
Customize the appearance of the chat button, including color, shape, and animation.

## 3. System Prompt

Define the brain of your AI assistant. This is where you tell the AI who it is and how it should behave.

### Prompt Instructions
- **Modify Prompt**: Edit the existing prompt to refine instructions.
- **Generate New**: Use AI to generate a new persona based on keywords.

### AI Behavior
Fine-tune parameters like creativity (temperature) and response length to control how the agent communicates.

## 4. Integration Method

Choose how you want to deploy the chatbot to your website.

### API Key
Use this key to authenticate API requests if you are building a custom integration.

### Domain Allowlist
Restrict widget access to specific domains to prevent unauthorized usage.
- Enter domains without the protocol (e.g., `example.com`, not `https://example.com`).
