VerlyAI uses RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to ground your agent's responses in your specific business data. This ensures accurate, on-brand answers without hallucinations.

## Adding Knowledge Sources

Your agent needs specific knowledge about your business to answer questions accurately. Navigate to the **Data Sources** tab in your agent's dashboard.
