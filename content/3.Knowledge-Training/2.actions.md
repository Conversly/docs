Actions are custom skills you teach your AI agent, allowing it to go beyond answering questions and actually **do things** — like fetching product prices, querying databases, submitting forms, or triggering workflows in external services.

![Actions Dashboard](https://fpfwsswoz0yfjtoz.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/Screenshot%202026-02-20%20at%201.04.52%E2%80%AFAM.png)

When your bot doesn't have any actions yet, you'll see the "Teach Your First Skill" prompt. You can create actions that:
- **Call APIs** — Fetch live data from any REST endpoint.
- **Query Databases** — Look up records from your internal systems.
- **Trigger Actions** — Fire off automations, send emails, create records.

Click **+ Teach Your First Skill** to open the Action Builder wizard.

## Creating a New Action

The Action Builder is a **5-step wizard**: General → API → Inputs → Test response → Data access.

### Step 1: General

Define the core identity of your action — what it is and when the AI should use it.

![Create New Action – General Settings](https://fpfwsswoz0yfjtoz.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/Screenshot%202026-02-20%20at%201.05.52%E2%80%AFAM.png)

| Field | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Action Name** | A unique identifier using lowercase letters, numbers, and underscores (e.g., `get_product_price`). |
| **Description** | Tells the AI *when* to trigger this action. Write it clearly so the model understands the context. |
| **Example User Queries** | Optional sample messages that help the AI learn when to trigger the action (e.g., "What's the price of item X?"). |

::prose-tip
**Example of a good description:**
"Use this action when the user asks about product prices, availability, or inventory. It fetches real-time pricing data from our e-commerce API. Requires a product ID or product name."
::

Click **Next: API →** to continue.

---

### Step 2: API

Configure the HTTP endpoint your agent will call.

![Create New Action – API Request](https://fpfwsswoz0yfjtoz.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/Screenshot%202026-02-20%20at%201.05.59%E2%80%AFAM.png)

| Field | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Method** | HTTP method: `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, or `DELETE`. |
| **HTTPS URL** | The full endpoint URL. Use `{param}` placeholders for dynamic path segments (e.g., `/v1/products/{id}`). |
| **Auth** | Authentication type: None, Bearer Token, API Key, or Basic Auth. |
| **Query (static)** | Static query parameters appended to every request. |
| **Headers (static)** | Static headers like `Content-Type` or custom API headers. |
| **Body** | For `POST`/`PUT` requests, define the request body structure. |

#### Import from cURL

You can quickly populate the API configuration by pasting a cURL command. Click **> Import from cURL**, paste your command, and hit **Parse cURL**.

![Import cURL Modal](https://fpfwsswoz0yfjtoz.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/Screenshot%202026-02-20%20at%201.06.14%E2%80%AFAM.png)

```bash
# Example cURL to import
curl -X POST https://api.example.com/v1/users \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer token' \
  -d '{...}'
```

Click **Next: Inputs →** to continue.

---

### Step 3: Inputs (Parameters)

Define what information the AI needs to extract from the user's message and pass to the API.

![Create New Action – Parameters](https://fpfwsswoz0yfjtoz.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/Screenshot%202026-02-20%20at%201.07.23%E2%80%AFAM.png)

For each parameter, you configure:

| Field | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Name** | The variable name referenced in the URL or body (e.g., `product_id`). |
| **Type** | Data type: `String`, `Number`, `Boolean`, `Array`. |
| **Description** | Helps the AI understand how to extract this value from conversation. |
| **Required** | Whether the parameter must be collected before the action can run. |
| **Default value** | Optional fallback if the user doesn't provide the value. |
| **Destination** | Where the value is sent: `Path`, `Query`, `Header`, or `Body`. |
| **Query key** | The key name used in the query string (e.g., `?product_id=...`). |
| **Allowed Values** | Restrict input to specific values (e.g., `USD, EUR, GBP` for a currency field). |

Click **+ Add Another Parameter** to add multiple inputs. Click **Next: Test response →** when done.

---

### Step 4: Test Response

Before saving, verify your action works correctly by running a live test.

![Create New Action – Test Response](https://fpfwsswoz0yfjtoz.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/Screenshot%202026-02-20%20at%201.07.32%E2%80%AFAM.png)

The test panel shows:
- **Action Name & Method** — Confirmation of what will be called.
- **Test Values** — Fill in sample parameter values (e.g., `product_id: 7823`).
- **Request Preview** — Shows the exact URL that will be called with your test values.
- **Headers** — Displays the headers that will be sent.

Click **▷ Run Test** to execute the API call. If the response looks correct, click **Next: Data access →**.

---

### Step 5: Data Access

Control how much of the API response your AI agent is allowed to use.



| Option | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Full data access** | The agent can read the entire API response (up to 20KB) to formulate its answer. |
| **Limited data access** | The agent only uses a specific extracted field you map. Falls back to the full response if the field is empty. |

::prose-tip
Use **Limited data access** when the API returns large payloads (e.g., full JSON objects) but you only need a single value like `price` or `status`. This keeps responses fast and focused.
::

Click **Save Action** to finish. Your action is now available to the agent.

---

## How Actions Are Triggered

Once saved, the agent automatically triggers an action during a conversation when:

1. The user's message matches the **description** or **example queries** you provided.
2. The AI extracts the required **parameters** from the conversation.
3. The API call is made in real-time.
4. The response is returned and the agent uses it to craft a reply.

::prose-note
Actions run in the background and are invisible to the user. The agent seamlessly incorporates the fetched data into its response.
