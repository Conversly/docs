Don't just count messages; understand them. VerlyAI automatically categorizes conversations into topics to help you make data-driven product decisions.

## Managing Topics

Organize your conversation data by creating custom topics or letting AI discover them for you.

- **Create Topic**: Manually define a topic (e.g., "Pricing Plans", "Website Chat") to track specific user intents.
- **Edit/Delete**: Refine your topic list as your product evolves.
- **System Topics**: The AI automatically tags conversations with relevant topics like "Customer Support", "Lead Qualification", or "Human Handoff".

## Intelligent Clustering

Our AI analyzes your chat logs to group similar questions and issues.

- **Common Issues**: Identify rising bugs or complaints (e.g., "Login Failed" or "Shipping Delay").
- **Feature Requests**: See what users are asking for that you don't offer yet.
- **Knowledge Gaps**: Discover questions the agent couldn't answer, indicating where your Knowledge Base needs updates.

## Sentiment Analysis

Track the emotional tone of conversations within each topic.

- **Positive**: "Great help", "Thank you".
- **Negative**: "Frustrated", "Just let me talk to a person".
- **Alerts**: Set up notifications when negative sentiment spikes for a specific topic.

Use Topic Analysis to improve your **System Prompt** and **Knowledge Base**. If users keep asking about "Refunds", make sure your refund policy is clearly indexed.
