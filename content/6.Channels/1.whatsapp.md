Connect your WhatsApp Business number to VerlyAI to automate customer support and sales.

## Connection Methods

You can connect your number in two ways:
1. **Connect with Facebook**: The easiest method, using the embedded signup flow.
2. **Connect Manually**: For advanced users who want full control over their Meta App configuration.

## Manual Setup Guide

If you prefer to configure your own Meta App, follow these steps to connect manually.

### 1. Webhook Configuration

First, you need to tell Meta where to send incoming messages.

1. Go to your **Meta App Dashboard** > **WhatsApp** > **Configuration**.
2. Find the "Webhook" section and click **Edit**.
3. Copy the **Webhook URL** and **Verify Token** from your VerlyAI dashboard and paste them into Meta.

### 2. API Credentials

Next, provide VerlyAI with the credentials to send messages on your behalf.

1. Go to **WhatsApp** > **API Setup** in your Meta App Dashboard.
2. Copy the following values:
    - **Phone Number ID**: The ID of the phone number sending messages.
    - **Access Token**: A System User Token (recommended for production) or Temporary Token (for testing).
    - **WhatsApp Business Account ID**: The ID of your overall business account.
3. Enter your **Phone Number** in E.164 format (e.g., `+1234567890`).
