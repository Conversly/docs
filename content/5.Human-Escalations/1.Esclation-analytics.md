Track human escalation volume, reasons, pickup time, and user abandonment.

## Key Metrics

The top of the dashboard provides a quick snapshot of escalation performance for the selected period.

- **Total Escalations**: The total number of conversations transferred to a human agent.
- **Escalation Rate**: The percentage of interactions that required human intervention.
- **Avg. Time to Human**: The average time a user waits before an agent picks up the chat.
- **User Abandonment**: The percentage of users who left the queue before connecting with an agent.
- **Volume**: A line chart visualizing the trend of total conversations vs. escalations over time.

## Detailed Analysis

Dive deeper into why escalations happen and how they are handled.

### Escalation Reasons & Handling
- **Escalation Reasons (Topics)**: Identify the specific topics or intents that lead to handoffs (e.g., "Billing", "Technical Support").
- **AI vs Human**: Compare the volume of conversations handled fully by AI vs. those requiring human involvement.

### Performance & Drop-offs
- **Time to Human**: Analyze the distribution of pickup times (p50, average, p95) to ensure service level agreements (SLAs) are met.
- **User Abandonment**: Track when users drop off during the wait time to optimize queue management.
