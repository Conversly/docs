The **Live Inbox** is the command center for your support team. When a user requests a human agent or the AI detects a situation that needs human attention, the conversation is routed here instantly.

## Conversation Queue

The left panel displays all escalated conversations in a real-time feed.

- **Search**: Find specific conversations by message content or reason for escalation.
- **Tabs**:
  - **All** — Every conversation across your team.
  - **Waiting** — Conversations that haven't been claimed yet by any agent.
  - **Mine** — Conversations you've personally claimed.
- **WS: Connected** — A live WebSocket indicator showing that your inbox is receiving real-time updates. Click **Refresh** to manually sync.

Each conversation card shows:
- **Preview**: The last message from the conversation.
- **Time**: How long ago the message was sent.
- **Status**: Whether the conversation has been claimed (e.g., "Claimed by Shashank Tyagi").

## Conversation Detail

Clicking on a conversation opens the full transcript on the right panel. You can see the complete chat history between the user and the AI — so you never have to ask the user to repeat themselves.

### Status Bar

At the top of each conversation, you'll see:
- **Active** indicator — The conversation is ongoing.
- **Reason for escalation** — A label showing why it was handed off (e.g., "user requested human").
- **Applied tags** — Tags extracted from the conversation (e.g., "i am good", "hi").
- **Close (✕)** — Close and resolve the conversation once the issue is resolved.

### Replying to a User

At the bottom of the conversation panel, you have a reply composer with two modes:
- **Edit** — Type and format your response.
- **Preview** — Preview how your message will look before sending.

Click **Claim this chat to reply** to take ownership of the conversation. Once claimed, you can type and send messages directly to the user.

- **Channel** — Shown at the bottom (e.g., `WIDGET`, `WA`) so you know which platform the user is on.

## Key Concepts

### Claiming a Conversation
To reply to a conversation, you must first **claim** it. This prevents multiple agents from responding to the same user simultaneously.

### Status Indicators
Each conversation in the list has a colored dot:
- 🟢 **Green** — The conversation is active and the user is currently online.
- ⚪ **Gray** — The user is inactive or the conversation has ended.

### Real-Time Updates
The inbox uses WebSockets (`WS: Connected`) to push new messages and escalations instantly — no need to manually refresh the page.

::prose-tip
Use the **Waiting** tab as your priority queue. These conversations have not been picked up by anyone yet and may have users actively waiting for a response.
