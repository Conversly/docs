## Why Voice AI?

- **Zero Wait Times**: Answer every call instantly, even during peak hours.
- **Natural Conversations**: Our agents handle interruptions, accents, and complex queries seamlessly.
- **Cost Effective**: Manage thousands of concurrent calls at a fraction of the cost of a call center.

## The Tech Stack

We've abstracted the complexity of building voice AI into a single platform:

1.  **Telephony**: Built-in phone number provisioning.
2.  **Transcription (STT)**: Real-time speech-to-text with <100ms latency.
3.  **Intelligence (LLM)**: GPT-4o optimized for conversational speed.
4.  **Speech Synthesis (TTS)**: Hyper-realistic voices from ElevenLabs and Deepgram.

## Capabilities

- **Inbound & Outbound**: Handle incoming customer service calls and run proactive outbound sales campaigns.
- **Real-time Analytics**: Track call duration, sentiment, and resolution rates instantly.
- **Transcription**: Get live, accurate transcripts of every conversation.
